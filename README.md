# BingDaily

A fun little side project that downloads the Bing Image of the day and makes it your background on macOS

Inspiration: Hammerspoon's [BingDaily](https://www.hammerspoon.org/Spoons/BingDaily.html) spoon.
Setting macOS Desktop Image: https://www.tech-otaku.com/mac/setting-desktop-image-macos-mojave-from-command-line/

## Running

For now, either build with `go build` or run the app directly with `go run bingdaily.go`.

At the moment, it's just me having a little fun.
